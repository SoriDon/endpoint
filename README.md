# Elastic Endpoint Security

The Elastic Endpoint provides deep, kernel-level data and adds free antivirus to the Elastic Stack.
Information on getting started with Elastic Endpoint Security is available
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/index.html).

Thanks for checking out the Elastic Endpoint. Protecting the world's data from attackers is our
passion. We're proud to secure your systems and hope you love Elastic Endpoint Security.

If you have any issues or questions with the Elastic Endpoint please get in touch. We'd love to hear
from you!

## Where to File Issues
Please file issues with the Elastic Endpoint that runs on protected hosts in this repository.

Issues with the Elastic Agent (which installs and manages the Elastic Endpoint) should be filed in
the [Beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats) repository and issues with the Kibana Security
application or Ingest Manager should be filed in the [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana)
repository.

If you're using malware protection and are experiencing false positives, you should be able to use
the
[exceptions workflow](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/7.9/detections-ui-exceptions.html) to
tune your environment. You can help us improve the feature though by telling us about false
positives. To do so, please use
[this](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/submitting-false-positives/232322) process.

If you aren't sure where to file an issue, don't worry. Just put it where it feels best placed.
We'll take it from there.
